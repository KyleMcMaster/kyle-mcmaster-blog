# Announcing the CSharpFunctionalExtensions.FluentAssertions Library!

Version 1.0.0 of [CSharpFunctionalExtensions.FluentAssertions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CSharpFunctionalExtensions.FluentAssertions) is now available on NuGet! This package enables developers to increase the readability of their tests by providing a more fluent way to write assertions based on common types such as `Maybe<T>` and `Result` from the CSharpFunctionalExtensions library.

## An Example from CSharpFunctionalExtensions.FluentAssertions

Let's take a look at what a xUnit test method with an assertion on a `Maybe<T>` object might look like first without and then with this new library.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void MaybeShouldHaveValue()
{
  int value = 4680;
  var maybe = Maybe.From(value);

  maybe.Value.Should().NotBeNull();
  maybe.Value.Should().Be(value); 
}
```

With the reference to the CSharpFunctionalExtensions.FluentAssertions library, the assertion of the test method can be changed to the following.

```csharp
maybe.Should().HaveSomeValue();
maybe.Should().HaveValue(value);
```

You can check out other sample usages of the CSharpFunctionalExtensions.FluentAssertions library in the [Usage](https://github.com/NitroDevs/CSharpFunctionalExtensions.FluentAssertions#usage) section of the project's readme. The library contains FluentAssertion extensions for `Maybe<T>`, `Result`, `Result<T>`, `Result<T, E>`, and `UnitResult<E>` types.

## Closing Remarks

This package was motivated by some of the tests I have been writing for [payroll processor](https://github.com/KyleMcMaster/payroll-processor) as I refactor that codebase from LanguageExt to CSharpFunctionalExtensions. This project's success should also be strongly attributed to the contributions by [Sean](https://twitter.com/seangwright) Wright](https://twitter.com/seangwright) for helping me through the process of publishing a NuGet package for the first time and establishing an automated deployment pipeline with the ability to generate a preview package easily. Give him a follow on Twitter! I'd also like to thank [Giovanni Costagliola](https://github.com/MrBogomips) for being the first community contributor to this project.
