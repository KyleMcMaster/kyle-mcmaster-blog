I recently attended CodeMash 2023 at Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio. This was my first time attending CodeMash and I was very impressed with the community, quality of talks, and overall experience the conference offered. Since it was such a great experience, I wanted to share some of my highlights in hopes it encourages others to attend in the future.

## My Schedule

There are quite a large number of talks for each time slot, so I had to be selective in what I attended but one of the upsides of this is that each time slot seemed to offer a little something for everyone. I mostly focused on talks that were related to .NET, architecture, and soft skills/productivity with a few exceptions.

## Top talks I enjoyed

- Aerospace Engineering for Computer Scientists
- Neurodiversity, Productivity, and Communication – A Survival Guide
- Level Up on Functional Programming By Rebuilding LINQ
- Observability Made Easy with .NET 7 and OpenTelemetry
